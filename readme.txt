This is Javascript implementation of various astronomical formulae
by Jean Meeus (Astronomical Algorithms, second edition) and
by Paul Schlyter (http://stjarnhimlen.se/)


Note: This project is still in early development, unit tests cover
very small fraction of code, over-simplified formulae by Schlyter
have low accuracy and calculations of Rise/Set/Transit times for the
Moon and physical ephemeris for inner planets are buggy
